    <p class="text_column">Physical bullying- is the use of physical force, such as hitting, kicking, or pushing, to harm or intimidate another person.  Certainly, here's a breakdown of the causes and effects of physical bullying:     </p>
    <p class="text_column">Causes:  1. Power Imbalance- Bullies may perceive themselves as stronger or more dominant than their victims, leading to acts of physical aggression.  2. Lack of Empathy- Some individuals engage in physical bullying due to a lack of empathy or understanding of the impact of their actions on others.   </p>
    <span class="text_column">We need to work together to stop physical bullying in our communities. It hurts people physically and emotionally. By being kind, showing respect, and having strong rules against bullying, we can make sure everyone feels safe and valued. Let's speak up, take action, and make our world a better, kinder place without bullying."    -Am-is, Elieza</span>
